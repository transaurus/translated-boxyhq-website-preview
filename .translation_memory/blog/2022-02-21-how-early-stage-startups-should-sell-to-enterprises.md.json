Once you understand the needs of the enterprise, it is time to focus on understanding the needs of your user and your buyer, most of the time these are two different stakeholders within the organization. Is the need of the user a priority for the buyer, or is it just a distraction? You will see that in some organizations they are aligned and in others, they cannot even stand each other; so you must take the time to understand the dynamics between these stakeholders, and the culture of the enterprise itself (how they make decisions).",

Enterprises have got plenty of software they already depend on that needs to work with whatever your product can do for them. Their technology is usually old, I have seen many enterprises with Frankensteins, they think they need to create a third leg to run faster and they end up building unnecessary technologies that affect the quality and the speed of their solutions.
