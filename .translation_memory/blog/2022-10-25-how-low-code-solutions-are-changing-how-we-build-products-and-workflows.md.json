Let’s take BoxyHQ and our SAML Jackson product as an example. Without the low-code product (SAML Jackson) the alternative for businesses would be to build a custom SAML integration which takes months and a ton of resources. This sounds ridiculous tho right? With the number of businesses who are deploying SAML for their customer, there must be some reusable parts that can be shared to reduce the time it takes each business. This is where low-code products like SAML Jackson come in. By building the SAML integrations as a reusable component, businesses only need to create one simple connection to the SAML Jackson to deploy SAML.",

If we look at a product like Zapier for example, that requires no code at all and a non-technical person can use visual blocks to connect different data sources and outputs to build workflows. An example of this is as a non-technical person I can take data from forms such as Hubspot forms that are submitted on our website and create notifications for the team on Slack. Doing all of this without code and just using Zapier is what makes this a no-code solution.",

With competitors springing up every day and customer expectations high the last thing a business wants to do is to have to make specialist hires for each element of their build or spend precious time on auxiliary features that also have their learning curve. The birth of plug-and-play has meant that businesses can operate faster and more efficiently than ever before. Can you imagine if a business had to build all its tools from scratch? No neither can I.\n\n2. **Cost**\n\n   Cost is always a major element that businesses and individuals look at when finding a solution and in the case of low-code it comes down to the question of build V buy. For larger enterprises who have not fully adopted the trust and efficiency of low-code they might still choose to build their own solution which will cost them a lot more in resources and time but that might be something, they have spare. Smaller businesses who want to focus on their core offerings will always look for reliable plug-and-play solutions such as low-code which allow them to quickly deploy solutions and stay competitive while saving on the large number of resources needed to build from scratch.",
