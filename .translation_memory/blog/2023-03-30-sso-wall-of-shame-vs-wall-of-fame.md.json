It’s hard to judge from the outside, and clearly companies need to make a profit while showing growth, especially when you are backed by Venture Capital.

Nonetheless, cybersecurity taxes should stop, and we should all focus on increasing our security posture and making a positive impact. Take for example, Hubspot charging 6300% more for SSO functionality! That is a clear example of how absurd and abusive some companies can be.",

With RFPs, security questionnaires, and other compliance-related procedures, closing an enterprise deal becomes all-consuming for a startup. This can justify an enterprise pricing tier. Given a startups early evolution of products, , Enterprise SSO becomes an easy candidate to distinguish the pricing tier gap between charging SMBs and what they can charge enterprises. But building and maintaining SSO is expensive and time-consuming. SAML is not necessarily the easiest protocol implementation to get right. And add to this the customer support issues that come with onboarding large enterprise teams onto the product. But as a startup matures the product needs to have enough core enterprise features and not merely depend on undifferentiated features like SSO.",
